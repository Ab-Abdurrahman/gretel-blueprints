# Running a transform model based on this config, will label each record and transform that
# record according to the labels that were detected in that particular record:
#  - fake values that are labeled with an entity that can be faked
#  - generate secure hash for everything else

# Configuration options:
#  - "fake" transform, see https://python.docs.gretel.ai/en/latest/transformers/xf_fake_constant.html
#  - "hash" transform, see https://python.docs.gretel.ai/en/latest/transformers/xf_secure_hash.html

# This config is useful for working with unstructured data, with free-form text, etc.
