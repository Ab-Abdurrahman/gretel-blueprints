# Create synthetic data from your own CSV or DataFrame

This blueprint will walk you through the process of creating your own synthetic data from a CSV or a DataFrame of your choosing.

No data will be sent to Gretel Cloud, to get started you just need to provide your own DF or CSV file. 

Please get an API key from the Integration menu, then start the Notebook flow. An example public dataset is provided for you 
but you can switch out your own dataset as needed.
