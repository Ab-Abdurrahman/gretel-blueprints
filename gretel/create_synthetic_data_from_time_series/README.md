# Create Synthetic Time Series Data

This blueprint utilizes a model type that will process source data to create a synthetic version of time series data.  With this model you
must specify a column that represents your time data points and then
one or more columns that represent your observation data.

This model will train and generate a new time series dataset that
is the same shape as the training data.
